[Verse 1]
Mmm, the boys of the empire
They set head on fire
Pull the plug, sire
I'll spit fire
Gents of the empire
Strangle my desire
Pull the plug, sire
And I'll spit fire

[Chorus]
I'm borderline happy and I'm borderline sad
I'm borderline good and I'm borderline bad
And I can't get rid of a tingling fear
You'd sort me out if my head gets clear
I live my life in shackles, but I'm borderline free
I used to be blind and I still can't see
And I won't get around to a change of mind
As long as nobody breaks my stride
